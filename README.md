# IoT_Smart_Home_Raspberry_Pi

<br>
The main objective of this project is to build a smart home device which 
can be used to control the home appliances via internet. The home 
automation device that we built can be integrated with almost all the 
home appliances and can be used to control them remotely from any 
part of the world.
In this project we use IOT based home automation system which goal 
is to develop a home automation system that gives the user complete 
control over all remotely controllable aspects of his or her home. The 
automation system will have ability to be controlled from a central host 
PC, the internet, and also remotely accessed via a packet PC with a web
based application.
